    "Roulette is a popular casino game played with a wheel that has numbered slots colored red, black, or green. In American roulette, the wheel has 38 slots: 18 red slots, 18 black slots, and 2 green slots labeled \"0\" and \"00.\"\n",

    "If you place a bet on black and the outcome is indeed black, you win and double your money. However, if the outcome is red or green, you lose the amount you bet. For example, if you bet 1 dollar on black and win, you gain 1 dollar. If you lose, you forfeit your 1-dollar bet.\n",
