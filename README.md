## Intro

This repository contains the assignments for the Data Science course at the University of Tehran. The assignments are completed by the group of students in the course and are used to demonstrate the skills and knowledge they have gained throughout the course. They are completed using the python programming language and are focused on data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. The assignments are completed using real-world data sets and are designed to give students hands-on experience with the tools and techniques used in data science. Apart from the assignments, the repository also contains the final project for the course, which is a group project that involves working on a real-world data science problem from start to finish. In the final project we were supposed to gather data, clean it, analyze it, and build a machine learning model to solve a specific problem.

## Assignment 0: Statistical Inference

This project serves as a practical introduction to core statistical principles in data science. It is divided into three distinct case studies. The first part uses Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the profitability of betting in a game of roulette, exploring concepts like expected value, standard error, and the Central Limit Theorem. The second part delves into predictive analysis by aggregating polling data from the 2016 US Presidential Election to calculate confidence intervals and test hypotheses about the electoral spread. The final part applies hypothesis testing (specifically, independent t-tests) to a drug safety dataset to determine if there are statistically significant differences between a drug and a placebo group.

## Project

### Phase 1: Data Collection

For this phase we chose to scrape [We Buy Car](https://www.webuycars.co.za/buy-a-car) website to gather data about the cars they have for sale. The gathered data includes the car's make, model, year, price, and much more.

### Phase 2: Data Cleaning

In this phase we cleaned the data we gathered in the previous phase. We removed any duplicates, missing values, and outliers. We also converted the data into a format that is suitable for analysis. We also performed some exploratory data analysis to gain some insights about the data.

### Phase 3: Regression Analysis

In this phase we used the cleaned data to train a regression model to predict the price of the cars. We used different regression techniques such as Neural Networks, SVM, Decision Tree, and other methods as well. We also used different feature engineering techniques to improve the performance of the model. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the model using different evaluation metrics such as the $R^2$ score and the Mean Squared Error (MSE).
